This folder contains all of the work done in my Mobile App Dev class. In this class, we learn how to create Android applications using Xamarin Forms. We also learn how to connect these apps with databases like SQLite and AWS.

This is to demonstrate my learning process over the course of the semester. While writing these programs, I used Visual Studio 2019 using Xamarin Forms projects.
