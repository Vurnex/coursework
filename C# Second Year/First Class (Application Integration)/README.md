This folder contains all of the work done in my App. Int. class. In this class, we learn about XML and work with it through C Sharp. We learn how to create XML files, validate them using DTD or XSD, and traverse, create, or manipulate XML files using various C# libraries like XPath and LINQ. We also learn about working with APIs and creating AWS databases. 

This is to demonstrate my learning process over the course of the semester. While writing these programs, I used Visual Studio 2019 project styles such as a console app, windows forms, and WCF Library. SQLite ans AWS were used for database purposes.
