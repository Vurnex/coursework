This folder contains all of the work done in my second course which went a bit more in-depth on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. That was the first half. The second half was learning PHP, which was the first time I worked with that language.

All of the files are unchanged from the term I completed them (Spring 2022). This is to demonstrate my learning process over the course of the semester. All of the individual labs should run fine. While writing these programs, I used Visual Studio Code along with XAMPP to run the PHP files and MySQL for database purposes.

For the project, I used CodeIgniter 4 for the MVC implementation
