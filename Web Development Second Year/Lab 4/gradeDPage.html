        <p>It's clear that some effort was put in at least. 
            Here are some ways you can improve: </p>
    
        <ul>

            <li><b>Work out where you’re falling short.</b> Figure out the areas in which 
                you’re underperforming, and why.</li>

            <li><b>Talk to your teachers.</b> Ask them where they think you need to improve, 
                and they’ll probably have some advice on how you can go about it.</li>

            <li><b>Improve your note-taking skills.</b> Notes should be readable, 
                useful / relevant, logically organised. </li>

            <li><b>Find the right learning style for you.</b> You might find it easier to work 
                with a friend or two, so that you have someone else there to motivate you.</li>

            <li><b>Stop procrastinating.</b> This is a common response to a big workload, 
            but only delays the inevitable!</li>

        </ul>
