This folder contains work that was from one of the two Java classes I took in Spring 2021 during my Junior year of my IT Degree. 

For this folder, I did NOT write most of this code. We were given pre-written code with some portions omitted, which is what we were responsible for figuring out. The portions that I wrote were mostly the insertion statements in the "App" files. 

This is uploaded to demonstrate my learning process throughout that semester. This class went over array sorting methods and tree traversal.
