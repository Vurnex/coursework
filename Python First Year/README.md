This folder contains all of the work done in my first Python course. These labs and projects were originally completed in Fall 2019. 

The was the first real programming course I took. The first half consisted of assignments on pseudocode and flowcharts which I did not retain unfortunately. The second half consisted of hands on programming in Python, all of which is uploaded here. 

The purpose of this folder is to demonstrate my learning process over the course of the semester. All of the individual labs and projects have been re-tested and should run fine.
